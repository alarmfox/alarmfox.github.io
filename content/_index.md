# Giuseppe Capasso (alarmfox)

This is my space where I write about my interests and thoughts which include (and are not limited to):

- Computers Systems
- Entertainment (books, videogames, music, film)
- Real world stuff

I am deeply interested in high-performance systems, software security, networking and all the low-level stuff.

If you are looking for a resume/CV (and *somehow* managed to get on this site) you can get one [here](https://github.com/alarmfox/curriculum-vitae/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

## Site organization
Although I use this site for everything (I don't like fragmentation), maybe it is a good 
idea to keep the [tech/research stuff](/tech-research-stuff) away from [personal thoughts](/thoughts).

### Target of this site
There is not a specific target for this website. 
Sometimes, one just needs a place to share thoughts and put ideas together. 

## Contacts
If you want to reach out write an email to capassog97@gmail.com.
